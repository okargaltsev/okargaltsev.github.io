  <h1>Identifying Fermi LAT sources with X-ray and multiwavelength data.</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Growing number of Fermi LAT sources, improving coverage of Galactic plane with Chandra (CXO) and XMM-Newton X-ray
    observatories, and deeper high-resolution optical, NIR, and radio surveys enable multiwavelength classification of
    unidentified LAT sources. These are typically very labor-intensive because of the large number of sources and large
    number of multiwavelength parameters (features) characterizing them. Therefore, Machine-Learning (ML) methods can be
    of a great help.</p>
  <h2>Sample definition</h2>
  <li> We have been analyzing unidentified 3FGL source located within &lt10 degrees from the Galactic plane. However,
    since with the recent release of 4FGL positions and significance of Galactic 3FGL source have changed substantially
    (see below). Therefore, we focus here only on those LAT sources whose 3FGL and 4FLG positions fall within 8’ (for
    ACIS-I) and 4’ (for ACIS-S) from the CXO pointing (which in many cases was not even intended to study the LAT
    source). </li>
  <li>4FGL catalog has several “kinds” of “unidentified” sources. Some sources are “associated” with known sources but
    the associations are uncertain. Below we only consider sources that are listed as in 4FGL catalog without any class
    or with class “unknown”. Note that some of these sources turn out to have credible associations that are not listed
    in the released 4FGL catalog (see an example below). </li>
  <h2>3FGL vs. 4FGL </h2>
  <li>Galactic Fermi LAT sources have a known tendency to disappear or move around in new releases. </li>
  <li>Within |b|&lt10 deg, only about 50% of unidentified 3FGL sources overlaps (within the 95% confidence positional
    uncertainties) with the 4FGL sources. </li>

  <p>Fig 1. A region of Galactic plane (the background image if from the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane survey) with 2FGL
    (magenta), 3FGL (yellow), 8-yr prelim (red), 4FGL (blue) 95% confidence ellipses shown.</p>
  <img src="slides/Picture2.png" width="800" alt="" />
  <p>Figure 2. The 3 upper panels show the histograms for unIDed Galactic (|b|&lt10 deg). Panels a and b show the
    histograms  of semimajor uncertainty ellipse for 3FGL and 4FGL sources. Panel c shows the distribution of offsets
    between the unIDed 3FGL and 4FGL sources whose positions are &lt10' from each other. The three bottom panels show
    the significance of the 3FGL LAT source (having a match in 4FGL within r&lt10'; panel d) and the size of the
    uncertainty ellipse (in 3FGL and 4FLG, panels e and f) as a function of separation between the 3FGL source and its
    best match in 4FGL. One can see that the offset between the 3FGL and 4FGL source does not depend noticeably on the
    3FGL source significance and that the correlation between the source uncertainty ellipse size and the separation
    improves if the 4FGL positional uncertainty is used (i.e. localized 4FGL sources tend to be closer to their 3FGL
    predecessors).</p>

  <h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
  <p>We have found a promising young pulsar candidate with a luminous PWN (3FGL J1016.5-6034). A short CXO imaging
    observation played a crucial role in the identification of this source. We also found two more pulsar candidates one
    of which may be in a low mass binary. In addition, we found some CV and AGN candidates but CVs (except when in nova
    outburst) are not known to be GeV sources. </p>
