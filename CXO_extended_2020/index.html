            <h2>Project Summary</h2>

            <p>
                An systematic automated search for extended sources is  carried out in  archival imaging observations
                performed
                with
                 Advanced CCD
                Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) onboard Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO). We selected all imaging ACIS observations within 10 degrees from the Galactic plane with exposure times  of 10 ks or longer. 
                In total we analyzed about 2,000 CXO observations during this project. We use DBSCAN density-based spatial clustering algorithm (Ester et al. 1996) implemented in <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html">Python's scikit-learn library</a>.  
               We describe the approach,  source detection  and characterization, and display our preliminary findings in the  interactive table.
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>CXO ACIS images have very low noise level enabling detection of faint extended sources;</li>
                <li>Galactic extended sources can be of rare/interesting types (e.g., pulsar wind nebulae, supernova
                    remnants);</li>
                <li>Extended source detection in X-rays can aid identification of sources at higher energies (GeV/TeV);
                </li>
                <li>Human eyes are very good at detecting patterns but often see features that don't exist in the noise; </li>
                <li>There are thousands of ACIS images in CXO archive - too many for a human to look at; </li>
                <li> Developed here approach can be useful for future X-ray astronomy missions (e.g., Athena). </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data selection and treatment</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>The CXO observation must be an imaging observation within 10 degrees from the Galactic plane  with ACIS-I or ACIS-S and exposure time of 10 ks or longer;</li>
                <li>The data are filtered to only keep photons with energies in 0.5â€“8 keV;</li>
                <li>Each CCD chip is analyzed separately.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Event-based algorithm for finding extended objects (steps performed per each ACIS chip):</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Standardize the data so that the coordinates
                    for each dimension have zero mean and unit standard deviation;</li>
                <li> Perform multiple DBSCAN passes with varying min_samples parameter (number of points in the neighborhood of a "core point") and then use the 
                    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/kneed/">   Python implementation </a> of <a href="https://raghavan.usc.edu//papers/kneedle-simplex11.pdf"> Kneedle algorithm</a> in order to find the optimal min_samples value;</li>
                <li>Construct lasso regions for each cluster by using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/alphashape/"> alpha-shape algorithm</a>;</li> 
                <li> Select and remove point sources (after accounting for varying PSF size with off-axis distance) using principal component analysis (PCA) and Hotelling's T-squared statistic; </li>
                <li> The background is estimated as an average surface density of photons on the chip outside the extended source regions;</li>
                <li> For each extended source candiate calculate the area, the total and net number of photons,
                    signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N),
                    and center of mass (to be used as source coordinates); </li>
                <li> Filter the remaining extended sources selecting those with S/N>5. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future developments</h2>

            <ul>
             <!---   <li> Use Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm to de-blend close by sources; </li> --->
               <li> While DBSCAN-based method is robust and provides good sensitivity to extended sources it often does not capture the full extent of the sources; density-based clustering may provide better characterization  of extended source properties (see our <a href="https://home.gwu.edu/~kargaltsev/cxo_extended/extended_new.html">   earlier work </a>) once initial detections are done with DBSCAN. 
                  </li>
                <li> Sources sharing common boundary across the chip gap to be merged into a single source; </li>
                <li>
                    If the spectra of extended sources are different from that of the background, we can use the
                    energies of
                    events as
                    an additional dimension for clustering analysis;
                </li>
                <li> Improve background estimation by finding the location with minimal surface brightness on the chip and using it for the background; </li>
               <!---   <li>Improve background estimations for heterogeneous non-Poissonian background using MC;</li>--->
                <li>Explore the supervised machine-learning (neural networks) to discern empty from non-empty images and
                    detect
                    sources.</li>
            </ul>
