            <h2>Project Summary</h2>

            <p>
                An automated search for extended sources is being carried out in the archival imaging observations
                performed
                with
                the Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD
                Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). We describe the approach, the source detection
                and characterization, and the results of performance testing, and preliminary findings from the searches
                preformed for
                the ACIS observations of the Galactic plane fields.
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>CXO ACIS has very low noise level, faint extended sources can be discovered;</li>
                <li>Extended objects can be of rare and interesting types (e.g., pulsar wind nebulae, supernova
                    remnants);</li>
                <li>Extended source detection in X-rays can aid identification of sources at higher energies (GeV/TeV);
                </li>
                <li>Human eyes are amazing but often see features that don't exist in the noise; </li>
                <li>There are many thousands of ACIS images - too many for a human to look at. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data treatment</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Must be an ACIS observation with exposure time >4ks;</li>
                <li>The data are filtered to keep photons with energies in 0.5â€“8 keV;</li>
                <li>Each CCD chip was analyzed separately, but then the regions and chips can be merged back;</li>
                <li>Images were pre-binned by a factor of 2 and 4 (currently in the database below) before running the
                    extended
                    object detection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Density-based algorithm for finding extended objects (steps performed per ACIS chip):</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Convolve the image with the fixed-size gaussian kernel (r=6'');</li>
                <li> Fined the minimum of the surfacce brightness in the convolved image while taking care of the edge
                    effects;
                </li>
                <li> Sample background from the original (not smoothed file) using circular region centered at the
                    location of
                    the minimum surface brightness, check the
                    the circular region does nto contain point sources; </li>
                <li> Create background image (with the size of original image) from the sampled background; </li>
                <li> Smooth the background image with the same gaussian kernel; </li>
                <li> Characterize the level of fluctuations in the background image by measuring MinMax values and
                    standard
                    deviation; </li>
                <li> Produce the net image by subtracting the smoothed background image from the smoothed original
                    image; </li>
                <li> Thresholding: Find ``connected'' regions (surrounded by closed boundary of arbitrary shape without
                    intersections) above the threshold set by multiplying
                    the background standard deviation by 3 (or taking the maximum background value if it exceeds the
                    3*STD
                    value.); </li>
                <li> Produce a mask image capturing these regions and the corresponding DS9 region files;
                </li>
                <li> For each extended source candiate calculate the area, the total and net number of photons,
                    signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N),
                    and center of mass (to be used as source coordinates); </li>
                <li> Filter sources on their size (to remove point sources whose sizes depend on off-axis distance) and
                    S/N
                    (selecting those with S/N>5); </li>
                <li> Generate an output table and export it into an online database (beta version is available below).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future developments</h2>

            <ul>
                <li> Apply Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm to de-blend close by sources; </li>
                <li> Sources sharing common boundary across the chip gap to be merged into a single source; </li>
                <li>
                    If the spectra of extended sources are different from that of the background, we can use the
                    energies of
                    events as
                    an additional dimension for clustering analysis;
                </li>
                <li>Improve background estimations for heterogeneous non-Poissonian background using MC;</li>
                <li>Explore the supervised machine-learning (neural networks) to discern empty from non-empty images and
                    detect
                    sources.</li>
            </ul>
